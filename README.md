# March 2025 - Dataset Search

1. **Request to Iași City Hall**  
   - **Purpose**: Identify the institution responsible for traffic monitoring and verify whether such data is collected.
   - I also spoke with someone from the Iași Local Police, who stated that they do not collect traffic data. The surveillance cameras are used strictly for exceptional situations such as accidents and crimes.  
   - **Status**: No response received.  

2. **Request to the Center for Technical Road Studies and Informatics**  
   - **Response**: The institution confirmed that *it does not conduct any measurements on national road sections administered by cities/municipalities*.  

3. **Request to the Municipal Traffic Management Company of Bucharest**  
   - **Status**: No response received.  

4. **Requests for access to the [UTD19](https://utd19.ethz.ch) dataset**  
   - Sent two requests to download the dataset.  
   - **Status**: No response received.

I rushed into searching for the perfect dataset without even knowing exactly what I need or want for this project. I don’t think there is a quick and easy answer to my question, so in the next few weeks, I will read the studies I can find and explore the best way to generate the data myself using a digital replica of the city of Iași.

Getting access to live camera feeds in the city seems nearly impossible—especially considering that a simple request has remained unanswered for over three weeks now. Even if I did get access, I would still need to implement a video-based traffic analysis algorithm, which would require a significant amount of time and resources.

For now, I am looking into the option of recreating a realistic digital copy of Iași, or at least a large part of it, using data from OpenStreetMap and refining it where necessary with JOSM. I will dedicate some time to understanding the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) software and attempting to simulate meaningful traffic data. As mentioned in *The Effect of the Dataset on Evaluating Urban Traffic Prediction* study, additional factors such as weather conditions play a crucial role in prediction models, so I will also investigate the feasibility of generating that data.

## Next Steps

- Replicating in digital the city of Iași
- Generate at least some urban traffic data
- Refine and improve the generated data for further analysis
